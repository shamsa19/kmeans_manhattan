# K-Means Image Segmentation with Manhattan Distance

This project demonstrates how to implement **K-Means clustering** from scratch to segment an image using:

- âœ… **Manhattan distance** (instead of Euclidean)
- âœ… **Custom centroid initialization** based on the center and spatial layout of the image
- âœ… Visualizations of clusters and pixel distributions

---

## ðŸ“¸ Example Results

### Manhattan Distance vs Euclidean Distance Paths

### Original vs Segmented Image


### Individual Clusters (Centroid-Colored)
